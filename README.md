# Avalanche
## Inspiration
We wanted to build a gadget to be able to provide security and motivation to people of all ages while they take part in their activities.
##What it does
Avalanche allows you to go skiing in the cold and majestic Alps, bike across the wavy lands of Fiorentina or simply go on your evening run, all without you having to worry about any medical unfortunate event. By periodically keeping track of various vital signs as heartbeat, body temperature, and shakiness, if any result out of the ordinary is recorded it will automatically signal the people that take care of you to let you know about your situation.
## How we built it
We used the .Net framework to give the user a friendly UI to keep track of their results and the Arduino setup to be able to track user data. We used the Ark Blockchain to securely save the user's records which is connected with the gadget.
## Challenges we ran into
Our major issue was to be able to integrate the various frameworks that we used together with one another in order to connect the data and create a constant flow.
## What we learned
We learned how to work with hardware and the Photon sensor, as well as setting up the Ark blockchain and making sure that the data was saved correctly.
## What's next for Avalanche
We would like to include a rewards system for users to get more active and to be more mindful of their health. In addition, we would partner with other interested third parties that could make use of the data provided by us in order to improve research and follow up on studies.
